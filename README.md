## About

NITSMUN was founded in 2014 when a group of like-minded people wanted to create a society for younger people to discuss, debate, and deliberate present-day crises whilst experiencing themselves being in the shoes of various world leaders. Ever since the first MUN session in 2014, our society has grown manifold with more enthusiastic people joining in and helping us emerge as one the best and most promising MUN societies in NE India. Our conference offers its delegates an unrivaled Model UN experience by running highly personalized, engaging, and dynamic committees
